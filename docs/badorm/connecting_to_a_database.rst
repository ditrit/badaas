==============================
Connecting to a database
==============================

Connection
-----------------------------

BaDORM supports the databases MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server using gorm's driver. 
Some databases may be compatible with the mysql or postgres dialect, 
in which case you could just use the dialect for those databases (from which CockroachDB is tested).

To communicate with the database BaDORM need a :ref:`GormDB <badorm/concepts:GormDB>` object, 
that can be created by following `gorm documentation <https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html>`_. 

BaDORM also offers the `badorm.ConnectToDialector` method that will allow you to connect to a database 
using the specified dialector with retrying. 
It also configures the `gorm's logger <https://gorm.io/docs/logger.html>`_ to work with 
`zap logger <https://github.com/uber-go/zap>`_.

.. TODO verificar esto del logger si no es mejorable, y tambien en el ejemplo no haga falta el logger este.

When using BaDORM with `fx` as :ref:`dependency injector <badorm/concepts:Dependency injection>` you 
will need to provide (`fx.Provide`) a function that returns a `*gorm.DB`.

Migration
----------------------------

Migration is done by gorm using the `gormDB.AutoMigrate` method. 
For details visit `gorm docs <https://gorm.io/docs/migration.html>`_.

When using BaDORM with `fx` as :ref:`dependency injector <badorm/concepts:Dependency injection>` 
this method can't be called directly. In that case, BaDORM will execute the migration by providing 
`badorm.BaDORMModule` to fx. For this to work, you will need to provide also a method that returns 
`badorm.GetModelsResult` with the models you want to include in the migration. 
Remember that the order in this list is important for gorm to be able to execute the migration.
