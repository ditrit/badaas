BaDORM |version|
==============================

BaDORM stands for Backend and Distribution ORM (Object Relational Mapping). 
It's the BaDaaS component that allows for easy persistence and querying of objects. 
It is built on top of `gorm <https://gorm.io/>`_ and adds for each model a service 
and a repository that allows complex queries without any extra effort.

BaDorm can be used both within a BaDaaS application and as a stand-alone application.
