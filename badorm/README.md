# BaDorm: Backend and Distribution ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

BaDorm is the BaDaaS component that allows for easy persistence and querying of objects. It is built on top of gorm and adds for each entity a service and a repository that allows complex queries without any extra effort.

BaDorm can be used both within a BaDaaS application and as a stand-alone application.
